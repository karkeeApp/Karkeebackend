<h3>Data Protection Terms</h3><br />

1. Member information kept by the club <br /><br />
 
The following are examples of personal data kept by the club: <br /><br />
 
- Full name - Driver license image - Photograph or video image - Mobile telephone number - Personal email address - Name and residential address - Name and residential telephone - Vehicle insurance certificate - Registration log card - Authorization letter (if you are not the registered owner of the registered car) <br /><br />
 
2. Do I need to do anything immediately? <br /><br />
 
There are two parts to the answer. Firstly, if you are a Member, the answer is no. The club has been and will continue to safeguard your data and to make sure that it is only used for the intended and communicated purposes. As a Member, you have access to information that you have voluntarily shared via the Membership Application Form. Throughout the course of your membership, the club may collect information about you and your interactions with the Managing Committee and that information is not covered under the PDPA, meaning, Members do not have access to that information. If you wish to view the rest of your personal data provided by you during the membership application process, you may do so in writing via email to singapore.mclub@@gmail.com <br /><br />
 
3. What about emails and are they covered under the Act? <br /><br />
 
Emails are covered under the Spam Control Act (SCA) which sets out a framework to manage unsolicited commercial electronic messages sent in bulk through electronic mail, text and multimedia messaging, otherwise known as "spam". The SCA requires organizations to, among others, provide an “unsubscribe” facility within an email message and include a header in the subject field of the message or where there is no subject field, as the first words in the message. 

<br /><br />

If you do not wish to receive email messages from the Club, you may do so in writing by sending an email to singapore.mclub@gmail.com. We highly encourage our Members to not unsubscribe from emails from the club. These messages are important to keep Members apprised of what’s happening at the club.
