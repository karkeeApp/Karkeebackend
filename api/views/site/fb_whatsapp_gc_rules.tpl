<h3>M Club of Singapore Facebook Group & Whatsapp Chat Group</h3>

<h3>Rules and Guidelines</h3> <br /><br />


Welcome to the official M Club of Singapore Facebook Group and Whatsapp Chat Group (hereafter called “groups”). Please kindly read and understand these rules and guidelines so that we can all share the passion of BMW M in a pleasant, healthy, and informative environment.
 <br /><br />

1. Group Purpose <br /><br />


The groups were created to provide a space where M Club of Singapore members can share their passion with other like-minded individuals online. It is a place to connect and stay in touch with members of ///M Club of Singapore, as well as registration for club events and activities.
 <br /><br />

The sharing of information that benefits ///M Club of Singapore members, BMW M owners and enthusiasts is encouraged. However, the groups are not advertising platforms where members are faced with unsolicited marketing messages outside of limited promotions directly relevant to club membership and participation.
 <br /><br />

2. Membership
 <br /><br />

The groups are primarily intended for ///M Club of Singapore members. All member requests must be approved by the ///M Club of Singapore ExCo (hereafter called “ExCo”) on a case-by-case basis, and members are added into the groups by an administrator or moderator of the groups. The ExCo, administrators or moderators are not obliged to provide any reasons for declining any applications.
 <br /><br />

Should you have any enquiries regarding official club membership or club event registration, please kindly contact the ExCo. Please note that any unsolicited enquires, requests or demands, whether on the groups, private messages or otherwise, will not be entertained and may be removed at the discretion of the administrators or moderators.
 <br /><br />

3. Content Guidelines
 <br /><br />

To ensure that ///M Club of Singapore is a healthy and safe environment for all, it is essential that all members of the groups adhere to the following rules and guidelines:
 <br /><br />

The guidelines and terms outlined on the Facebook Terms and Policies at https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards and Whatsapp Legal Info at https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/ should be complied with, along with any applicable laws and regulations. Members are solely responsible for any postings they make in the groups.
 <br /><br />

3.2 Respect
 <br /><br />
Please maintain mutual respect for other members in the groups.

 <br /><br />

3.3 Content Rights
 <br /><br />
You must own the rights or have permission to use any content that you post on the groups. Should the ExCo, administrators or moderators receive any information, report or complaint of infringement of content or violation of privacy rights, or any material that may be deemed at the sole discretion of the ExCo, administrators or moderators to violate copyright or other property rights, the content in question may be edited or removed without notice.
 <br /><br />

3.4 Commercial Solicitation
 <br /><br />
Group members may not post or spam the groups with any content or posting that invites other members to contact the poster to conduct sales transactions, except at the sole discretion and explicit prior approval of the page administrators or moderators. For any such products / services / promotions, the ExCo, administrators and moderators would like to remind all sellers and buyers relying on any information placed on the groups that both sellers and buyers are solely responsible for all aspects of the transactions in which they choose to participate, as the ExCo, administrators and moderators may not be able to review or authenticate the items offered for sale, nor does it warrant any such product or service in any way.

If you feel that any content in these groups is inappropriate, violates the rules and guidelines or is otherwise contrary to the goals of these groups or the interests of participants, please contact the ExCo, administrators or moderators for review.
 <br /><br />

Please note that the ExCo, administrators or moderators reserve the right to decline, edit or remove any content, postings or persons from the group without any notice or explanation.
